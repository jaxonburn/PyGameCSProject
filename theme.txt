For our theme we decided to go with a medieval 8-bit theme. So for our main character we have a knight that once he gets a sword
the avatar changes to one with a sword. For obstacles we had an 8-bit monster and fireball as those seemed to match our theme.
To win the game you must reach level 3 where there is a treasure after getting through some doors by hitting buttons.
